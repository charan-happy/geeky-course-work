## Assignment 1: Minio Integration with Express
Objective:
Integrate Minio as a file storage solution into an Express.js application.

Task:

Set up Minio:


Set up Minio either on your local machine or use a Minio cloud service. Configure the Minio server with access and secret keys.

Integrate Minio with Express:


Implement file upload functionality using Minio's SDK.

Allow users to upload files (e.g., images, documents) to Minio storage through the Express.js application.

Implement functionality to retrieve files from Minio storage and serve them to users.

Ensure File Management:


Implement the ability to delete files from Minio storage.

Handle errors and edge cases (e.g., file not found, upload failure).

## Assignment 2: Redis Integration with Express
Objective:
Integrate Redis into an Express.js application for basic caching and session management.

Task:

Set up Redis:


Set up a Redis server on your local machine or use a Redis cloud service like Redis Labs.

Cache Data with Redis:


Create a simple route in the Express.js app where you store some data (e.g., user information, page content) in Redis.

Use Redis to cache this data and return it to the user without querying the database repeatedly.

 

Ensure Redis Connection Management:


Ensure the Express app connects to Redis efficiently and handles connection errors gracefully.

## Assignment 3: MongoDB Integration with Express
Objective:
Integrate MongoDB into an Express.js application to perform basic CRUD operations.

Task:

Set up MongoDB:


Set up a local MongoDB instance or use MongoDB Atlas for cloud-based MongoDB.

Integrate MongoDB with Express:


Connect the Express.js application to the MongoDB database.

Implement basic CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for a sample resource, such as a "User" model, in MongoDB.

Ensure Efficient Query Handling:


Use appropriate MongoDB query methods for reading and writing data.

Implement error handling to ensure the app handles database failures gracefully.
